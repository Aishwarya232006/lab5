This website is created by basic html and css style tags.
In this website I've included two pages , the main page index.html and the other page artists.html also I've included a stylesheet in the folder and several multimedia things like images , audio and video.
So let's have a look at the first page, here I've included a navbar with some links of pages including artist.html page and also I added a logo which says spotify on it and with the help of the css styling sheet which I've linked in both the pages , I was able to set the beautiful linear gradient thing as the background image of the navbar.
After this to make the web page look good I add the hover thing also with the help of stylesheet but only on one of the navbar link which actually takes you to a different page on clicking which is the "songs" element in the navbar .
Moving forward in the page we can see an audio and then a video as well with h1 heading on their top.
Next you could see some random pictures related with music artists whose cards I've included in the next page.
After that I add a basic form here with a submit button with the same designing as in the navbar using the same "linear gradient".
at last there is the "footer" of the pageAlso I've used the media tag for "footer" for max width of 1024px.
Now in the next page there are just cards which I tried to position but it didn't work out for me I played around with several things such as borders, paddings. margin, also I included the font UBUNTU from the google fonts so I changed the paragraphs' fonts by adding that in stylesheet.
In the cards I added the "iframe" tags which I embeded from the spotify itself. 
Plus in the cards I've included the links too which will take you to the spotify's that artist's playlist itself.
So yeah this was pretty much all about my website on Music.
